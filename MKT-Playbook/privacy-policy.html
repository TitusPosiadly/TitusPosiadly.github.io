  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>By using the application, you hereby consent to my Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the application. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>For a better experience, while using the app, I may require you to provide me with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.</p>

    information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave the app.</p>
